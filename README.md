# ralph-parallel

Parallel spec execution plugin for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code). Works with [ralph-specum](https://github.com/tzachbon/smart-ralph) to dispatch spec tasks to Agent Teams for concurrent execution.

## What It Does

Takes a spec generated by ralph-specum, analyzes task dependencies and file ownership, then dispatches parallelizable groups to Agent Team teammates for simultaneous execution. Coordinates the team through phase gates and quality checkpoints.

## Install

```bash
# 1. Install ralph-specum first (prerequisite)
claude plugin marketplace add tzachbon/smart-ralph
claude plugin install ralph-specum@smart-ralph

# 2. Install ralph-parallel
claude plugin marketplace add kavanaghpatrick/ralph-parallel
claude plugin install ralph-parallel@ralph-parallel

# 3. Restart Claude Code
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ralph-parallel:dispatch` | Analyze tasks, partition into groups, spawn teammates |
| `/ralph-parallel:status` | Monitor parallel execution progress |
| `/ralph-parallel:merge` | Verify and integrate results (worktree strategy) |

## Strategies

- **file-ownership** (default): Each teammate owns specific files. No merge step needed.
- **worktree**: Each teammate gets a git worktree. Requires `/merge` after completion.

## How It Works

1. **Parse**: Reads `tasks.md` from your spec, builds a dependency graph
2. **Partition**: Groups tasks by file ownership to avoid conflicts
3. **Dispatch**: Creates an Agent Team, spawns teammates with scoped prompts
4. **Coordinate**: Manages phase gates, quality checks, and teammate lifecycle
5. **Complete**: Shuts down team, marks dispatch as merged

## Demo Results

- **user-auth** (12 tasks, 4 teammates): ~3.4x speedup
- **gpu-graphics-demo** (12 tasks, 3 teammates): Full Rust/wgpu app built in parallel

## Requirements

- Claude Code with Agent Teams support
- ralph-specum plugin (for spec generation)
- Python 3.10+ (for analysis scripts) — macOS ships with 3.9; install via `brew install python`
- `jq` (for hook scripts) — install via `brew install jq`
